Things learned

look at datasets first, plan out structure of final dataset
	plan out steps in order
	decide which variables want, how will make them

order tasks correctly - make things more likely to change and more important to document come later
	for instance, code offenses as "reactive" or "proactive" late in the process, so can change easily
